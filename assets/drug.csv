I have gained about 10lbs from it, and my sex drive is gone about halfway through activity. And I&#039;ve also been feeling bloated. I&#039;m not totally  satisfied with the product but not totally dissatisfied since it obviously works. Debating going off it though.""",5,2,abnormal,abnormal,102,18,vomting and headache
Guaifenesin / pseudoephedrine,60,Cough and Nasal Congestion,"""I have severe sinus problems all year long, but worse in the fall. The pressure pain is almost unbearable. My doctor has prescribed everything under the sun to help relieve the symptoms and nothing works better than Mucinex D. I never have any drainage with my sinuses...just the pain/pressure and I can get almost immediate relief after I take 1 bi-layer tablet (1200mg guaifenesin and 120mg pseudoephedrine).  The medicine says it has an immediate release layer that works quickly and it does.  Then it has an extended release layer that works over the next few hours.  I also have the side effect of insomnia, but it&#039;s so worth it to relieve that sinus pressure (those of you who have it know what I&#039;m talking about!).""",9,12,normal,normal,99,67,headache and dizziness

Phentermine / topiramate,7.5,Weight Loss,"""I have been on every diet known to man kind.  I have been told by my physician that if I don&#039;t do something, I am going to become diabetic.  I went to my doctor when I heard about this medication and was told he did not write diet pills.  He told me I needed to exercise more and eat better.  He said It would only give me temporary results.  However, after reading everything I could find on Qsymia, I found that it is indicated for long term use.  I figured I would have a better chance eating right if I weren&#039;t starving and battling cravings every time I tried.  I actually changed doctors because I felt my doctor was minimizing my issue.  He won&#039;t treat my obesity but he will let me become a diabetic! I have lost 17 lbs in 2 months.""",10,113,abnormal,abnormal,97,74,heatburn
